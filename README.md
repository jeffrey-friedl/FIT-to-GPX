# FIT-to-GPX

Simple Perl script which, in conjunction with a Java script from the ANT consortium's FIT SDK,
converts a FIT file to a GPX file appropriate for upload to Strava.

Requires the free FIT SDK from https://www.thisisant.com/developer/resources/downloads/
As of May 2017, the SDK works with FIT versions 1 and 2.
